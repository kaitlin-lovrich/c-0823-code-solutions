## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the `async` and `await` keywords used for?
  The async keyword turns a function into an async function, which allows you to use the await keyword in its body
- How do `async` and `await` differ from `Promise.then` and `Promise.catch`?
  Promises are a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code that allows for chaining . then() and . catch() methods, while
  Async/await provides a more procedural syntax that makes asynchronous code look similar to synchronous code, with better error handling capabilities.
- When do you use `async`?

- When do you use `await`? When do you _not_ use `await`? (What happens if you `await` a synchronous function?)

- How do you handle errors with `await`?

- What do `try`, `catch` and `throw` do? When do you use them?

- What happens if you forget to use `await` on a Promise? In that case, what happens to the Promise rejection?

- Which style of asynchronous programming do you prefer â€” callbacks, `Promise.then`, or `async/await`? Why?

## Notes

Anytime you want to get the resolved value out of a PROMISE you AWAIT it
if you do not, it will return a promise
