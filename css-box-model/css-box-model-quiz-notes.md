How to write `Code Examples` in markdown

for JS:

```javascript
const data = 'Howdy';
```

for HTML:

```html
<div>
  <p>This is text content</p>
</div>
```

for CSS:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
}
```

max-width: 100%, and its intrinsic width is smaller than its container, the image will not be forced to stretch and become larger, thus preventing pixelation.

list-style: none; gets rid of the bullet points

{box-sizing: border-box} changes the actual content size when the padding size is changed
border box changes the size of the entire box

{box-sizing: content-box} changes the width of the content when the padding size is changed
content box changes the size of just the content

{margin: 0 auto;} <- how to center content
