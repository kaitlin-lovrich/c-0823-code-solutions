## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a React component?
  React components are JavaScript functions that return markup
- How do you define a component in React?
  with a function keyword and a variable with a Capital first letter
- How is a component "rendered" (made visible on the browser page)?
  After you trigger a render, React calls your components to figure out what to display on screen. “Rendering” is React calling your components. On initial render, React will call the root component. For subsequent renders, React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render.
